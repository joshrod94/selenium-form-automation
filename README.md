# Selenium Form Automation

This project uses Selenium WebDriver with Java and Maven to automate filling out a web-based job application form. It is based on the selenium-java-starter template and is designed to simulate real-world user input across various form elements.

## Features

- Opens a demo form page using Selenium WebDriver
- Fills out:
   - Text input fields (First Name, Last Name)
   - Radio buttons (Gender, Experience)
   - Date picker
   - Checkboxes (Profession, Tools)
   - Dropdown selection (Continent)
- Submits the form
- Verifies successful submission (confirmation or change in page state)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshrod94/selenium-java-starter.git

2. Open in IntelliJ (or your IDE of choice).

3. Run the TestClass class to see a Chrome browser open Google.

4. The browser will quickly close and in your terminal, you will see the result of the test.
    
5. Customize the code as needed for your automation tasks.
